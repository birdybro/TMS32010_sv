# Integration documentation

- `mister_wrapper.md`: platform-neutral MiSTer/FPGA callback wrapper, reset,
  ready/hold, clock-enable, debug, and clock-domain contract.
- `hard_drivin_requirements.md`: Atari Driver Sound Board research and the
  eventual board-specific adapter requirements.

The generic processor and MiSTer wrapper do not contain Atari memory maps,
ROM content, DAC transforms, or host-handshake behavior. Those belong in a
separate Hard Drivin'-specific integration layer after their evidence is
qualified.
