# Integration documentation

- `mister_wrapper.md`: platform-neutral MiSTer/FPGA callback wrapper, reset,
  ready/hold, clock-enable, debug, and clock-domain contract.
- `hard_drivin_requirements.md`: Atari Driver Sound Board research and the
  eventual board-specific adapter requirements.
- `hard_drivin_communication_ram.md`: primary-transcribed CRAMEN ownership,
  512-word communication RAM, shared sound-address counter, and source
  conflicts around ports 1–3.
- `hard_drivin_mister_wrapper.md`: partial same-clock processor/program-RAM
  top, reset/ownership protocol, physical I/O callback, and test boundary.

`rtl/wrappers/hard_drivin_sound_bus_decode.sv` is the first board-specific
piece: a storage-free transcription of the verified program-RAM ownership,
low-eight port decode, and TBLW/OUT alias. It deliberately reports invalid
host/DSP overlap rather than inventing arbitration.

`rtl/wrappers/hard_drivin_sound_program_ram.sv` adds an FPGA-oriented,
same-clock 4K-by-16 storage adapter around that decoder. It uses synchronous
reads and explicit commit inputs, does not clear program contents, and grants
neither side during invalid overlap. Its whole-word host callback is not a
68000 byte-lane or DTACK implementation.

`rtl/wrappers/hard_drivin_sound_mister.sv` connects those pieces to the
generic processor callback wrapper. It can execute a host-loaded synthetic
program and correctly routes low-address TBLW to physical I/O, but leaves all
peripheral implementations and the 68000 bridge external.

`rtl/wrappers/hard_drivin_sound_communication_path.sv` combines a standalone
512-by-16 communication-RAM adapter with the primary-defined shared-address
and port-6 control state. It exhaustively verifies CRAMEN ownership and every
word, but is not yet connected to `hard_drivin_sound_mister` and does not
implement a 68000 bus, physical HM6116 timing, or serial sound-ROM data path.

The generic processor and MiSTer wrapper do not contain Atari memory maps,
ROM content, DAC transforms, or host-handshake behavior. Those belong in a
separate Hard Drivin'-specific integration layer after their evidence is
qualified.
