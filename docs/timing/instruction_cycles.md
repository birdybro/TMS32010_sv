# Instruction-cycle matrix

## Primary summary

The revision-B instruction summary supplies the following family-level
baseline [ti-tms32010-users-guide-spru001b, Table 3-2, printed pp. 3-5–3-7
(PDF pp. 55–57)]. **Confidence: VERIFIED_PRIMARY.**

| Cycles | Words | Instructions |
|---:|---:|---|
| 1 | 1 | accumulator, auxiliary, T/P/multiply, status/control, and data-memory operations except rows below |
| 2 | 2 | `B BANZ BGEZ BGZ BIOZ BLEZ BLZ BNZ BV BZ CALL` |
| 2 | 1 | `CALA RET PUSH POP IN OUT` |
| 3 | 1 | `TBLR TBLW` |

This is evidence for architectural cycle totals, not yet for pin-level
subphases. Every individual row, addressing mode, conditional outcome, and bus
trace still needs an automated assertion before `TIMING-001` can complete.

## Qualified timing tests

None. A model test that increments a software cycle counter is not sufficient
evidence of RTL cycle accuracy.

## Open timing dimensions

- whether taken and untaken conditions have identical two-cycle totals;
- exact immediate-word fetch ordering for branch and call;
- interaction of program fetch with internal data RAM;
- table-operation discarded fetch order;
- interrupt entry latency and recognition boundary;
- board-level phase stretching in the absence of a READY pin.

These map to `OQ-001`, `OQ-004`, and `OQ-007`. Reset-to-first-fetch timing is
resolved and tested in the standalone native phase engine, but it is not yet
integrated with the execution pipeline.
